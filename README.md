# EscapeTheCube
Escape the Cube is an audio-visual Unity game I made during a winter course at Virginia Tech. It was made in The Cube, a $15 million facility for art, data visualization, and research. It interfaces with a 360 degree cyclorama display, a motion capture system, and a large surround sound speaker array, so sadly this is likely not a project for you to download and try yourself.
